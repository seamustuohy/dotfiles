# Description   : Host sided script that gets rid of junk such as deleted document metadata
#                 aswell as documents with no metadata assigned

# Dependencies  : ssh, nc

# Notations     : This script may conflict with the cloud as it ignores the original purpose of the "deleted" attribute
#                 in metadata files. Upon conflict, the device will re-download the deleted document from the cloud as soon
#                 as connection can be established. That is, unless the file wasn't uploaded to the cloud in first place.

#                 To make it clear, this script is mainly intended for users that rarely use wifi on their device or users that
#                 frequently manually remove or add entries to the filesystem

# Current version (MAJOR.MINOR)
VERSION="1.0"
