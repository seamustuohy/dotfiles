# This configuration file contains lines in the following form
#     <config-command> <arg1> ....
# The configuration file can also contain comments, which start with the # character and go as far as the end of line.
# If you need to enter a configuration argument that contains spaces, use quotes (") around the whole argument.

# It possible to integrate the output of external commands into the configuration. The text between two backticks (`) is evaluated as shell command, and its output is put on its place instead. This works like backtick evaluation in Bourne-compatible shells and allows users to use external information from the system within the configuration. Backticks and # characters can be escaped with a backslash (e.g. \` and \#); in that case, they’ll be replaced with literal ` or # in the configuration.
#   for example:
#     `gpg -d ~/dotfiles/private/newsboat/secret_configs.gpg`
